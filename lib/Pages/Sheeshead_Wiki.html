                    family of games. It is the Americanized version of a card

                    century under the German name <i><a href="/wiki/Schafkopf" title="Schafkopf">Schafkopf</a></i>. 
                    Sheepshead is most commonly played by five players,<sup id="cite_ref-basic_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-basic-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> 
                    but variants exist to allow for two to eight players. 
                    There are also many other variants to the game rules, and 
                    many slang terms used with the game.

                    High German</a> and referred to playing cards on a barrel

                    Also, there are 6 of each &quot;<i>fail</i>&quot; suit (18 
                    total).<sup id="cite_ref-basic_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-basic-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>

                    Clubs, spades, and hearts take no precedence over other 
                    fail suits, unlike trump, which always take fail. (Notice 
                    how both aces and tens outrank kings; arguably the most 
                    confusing aspect of card strength). The lead suit must be 
                    followed if possible; if not, then any card may be played 
                    such as trump (which will take the trick), or a fail card. 
                    Playing a fail of a different suit is called &quot;<i>throwing 
                    off</i>&quot; and can be a way to clear up another suit. 
                    Additionally, throwing off a point card is called &quot;<a href="#Smear">schmearing</a>.&quot;

                    There are 120 points total in the deck. The goal of the 
                    game is to get half of these (60 or 61); in case of a tie, 
                    the player who picked up the blinds loses, and that 
                    player's opponents win. (There are variant rules for more 
                    peculiar situations, such as the <a href="/wiki/Leasters_(Sheepshead)" title="Leasters (Sheepshead)" class="mw-redirect">Leaster</a>.)

                    Score is kept using points (not to be confused with the 
                    point values of the cards) or using money. Points are

                    variations, with a different number of players</a>, have

                    value of cards taken during the hand. When playing for 
                    money, each point generally represents a common money unit.

                    The deck is shuffled and cut. The dealer then deals cards, 
                    starting with the player to the dealer's left, and 
                    typically two or three at a time to each person. In most 
                    standard five and six-handed games, two cards are also 
                    dealt to a separate pile called the &quot;blind.&quot; Usually this 
                    is dealt as a pair between rounds of dealing at any time 
                    so long as the last two cards are not dealt into the blind 
                    (because the dealer might inadvertently reveal the bottom 
                    card while dealing or shuffling).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When done with a five-handed deal, each player should have 
                    six cards, with two in the blind.

                    In one variant, a player may require a redeal if the

                    The player to the left of the dealer gets first choice to 
                    take the <b>blind</b> (the two face-down cards not dealt 
                    to any player). If he passes, the option is given to the 
                    next player (in clockwise order). There several <a href="#Play_variations">Variations</a> 
                    for if the dealer does not wish to pick up the blind&#8212;the 
                    dealer may be required to pick up the blind, or may have 
                    the option to call a Leaster, or may be able to call a 
                    Doubler.

                  <p>
                    The individual who takes the blind is called the &quot;<b>picker</b>&quot;. 
                    The picker adds the two cards in the blind to his hand and 
                    then must choose two cards to lay down or &quot;<b>bury</b>&quot;. 
                    The buried cards are added to the picker's score if the 
                    picker's side takes at least one trick.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The picker may also have a partner on his team who will 
                    then play against the remaining players. Depending on the 
                    variant or house-rule, the partner must automatically be 
                    the player with the jack of diamonds, or the picker may be 
                    able to call the ace of a fail suit and have that player 
                    be his partner. These are discussed in the <a href="#Play_variations">Variations</a>

                    One of the more intriguing aspects of Sheepshead is that 
                    the picker and partner change each hand, and a good deal 
                    of the game's strategy is in determining which player is 
                    the partner, as his identity is usually not revealed until 
                    after the game has begun.

                    After the picker has buried his cards, the person to the 
                    left of the dealer plays the first card. Play continues 
                    clockwise until everyone has played. Then, the person who 
                    played the card with the highest strength takes the &quot;<b>trick</b>&quot; 
                    (the highest trump, or if none, the highest card of the 
                    fail suit that was led). The player who took the previous 
                    trick then plays, or &quot;<b>leads,</b>&quot; a new card for 
                    the second trick. After all tricks have been taken, their 
                    point values are totaled and the winner declared, with all 
                    players adding or reducing their personal points 
                    accordingly (see the charts, above). The deal then shifts 
                    to the person to the left of the previous dealer.

                      The picker and partner should almost always lead trump. 
                      The picker should have the strongest hand, as he 
                      received additional cards, received free points in his 
                      bury, and hopefully had a stronger hand before picking. 
                      So for each trump he loses, four trump are lost by the 
                      other players. This is especially important in the <i>called 
                      aces</i> variant, as this gives the ace a much better 
                      chance of <b><a href="/wiki/Walk_(Sheepshead)" title="Walk (Sheepshead)" class="mw-redirect">walking</a>,</b> 
                      or going around the table without being trumped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When the picker is weak, sometimes it may be wise to 
                      lead fail and hope that the partner can take the trick. 
                      In these circumstances, the partner leading trump may 
                      drain the picker's trump faster than a strong opponent, 
                      though this strategy may be dangerous if the partner is 
                      still unknown.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Generally speaking, it is better to clear out as many 
                      suits of fail as possible when burying; it is better to 
                      have two clubs than to have a heart and a club. There 
                      are exceptions to this rule.

                    <li>
                      Generally, it is best not to pick up the blind unless 
                      the player has four or more trump in a five-handed game, 
                      and it is best if at least one of those trump is a 
                      queen. Picking on three trump is unwise, unless they are 
                      very highly powered cards or the picker has point cards 
                      to place into the blind

                      In the <i>called aces</i> variant, the opponents should 
                      usually lead another card of the called suit, as it is 
                      required by rule that the picker and partner must have 
                      and play a card of that fail suit for sure. Since there 
                      are five players and (usually) six cards in each fail 
                      suit, it is likely that one of the opponents will <i>not</i> 
                      have a card of that suit and thus be able to trump the 
                      trick and take the called ace for at least 11 points. If 
                      the opponents wait, an opponent might be able to <a href="/wiki/Sheepshead_(game)#Throwing_Off" title="Sheepshead (game)">throw 
                      off</a> his single card in the called suit and 
                      thereafter be able to trump the first trick of the 
                      called suit. However, waiting is dangerous because there 
                      are only six tricks in the five-player game, and the 
                      picker usually tries to lead trump and thus bleed the 
                      opponents of their trump&#8212;in part for the very purpose of 
                      avoiding this tactic by the opponents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the picker has one card of a given suit, they are 
                      more likely to have another card of that same suit than 
                      to have one of another fail suit. Leading that suit back 
                      at them (if possible) is a common strategy that will 
                      allow for a greater chance for the opponents to be able 
                      to trump or <a href="/wiki/Sheepshead_(game)#Schmear" title="Sheepshead (game)">schmear</a> 
                      the trick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Watch for suspicious play. If a player schmears an ace 
                      or ten in front of the picker, there's a good chance 
                      that they are the partner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Never lead trump unless absolutely necessary; doing so 
                      will likely hurt the opponent's team more than the 
                      picker/partner.

                      Point counting is a very valuable skill when playing 
                      Sheepshead, as it enables a player to know if a trick 
                      must be taken or if they've already won, enabling them 
                      to change their strategy to try for a greater victory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Trump counting is also important to keep track of the 
                      number of trump that have already been played, 
                      especially the queens and to a lesser extent the jacks.

                      The order of play is a very important consideration

                    There are a number of different play variations for 
                    Sheepshead. Variants may change how partners are chosen, 
                    scoring, the suits considered fail, or what occurs when 
                    the blind is not picked. Variations in the number of 
                    players is discussed in the next section.

                    The following two variants apply only to five and 
                    six-player games, and possibly four-player games. Variants 
                    differ in whether the picker is permitted to choose to 
                    play alone, and in whether there are some situations where 
                    the picker may be <i>required</i> to play alone.

                    The picker chooses a <i>called ace suit</i> after picking 
                    the blind. Whoever has this called ace will be his 
                    partner. There are a few further rules behind this.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The called suit must be a fail suit (clubs, spades or 
                      hearts).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The picker must have at least one of the fail suit in 
                      his/her hand. The picker <i>must</i> keep at least one 
                      card of the fail suit in his hand (i.e. cannot <a href="/wiki/Sheepshead_(game)#Throwing_Off" title="Sheepshead (game)">throw 
                      them all off</a>) until the first trick for which that 
                      suit is led, and then of course must follow suit. Also 
                      on the first trick for which that suit is led, the 
                      partner <i>must</i> play the ace (even if the player has 
                      another card of that suit).

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          If the picker has all 3 fail aces, he may call a 10 
                          instead of an ace. The picker is obligated to hold 
                          the ace of that suit in his hand. When the called 
                          suit is led, the picker must play the ace. In 
                          addition, the person with the 10 takes the trick if 
                          it is not trumped.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If the picker does not have all 3 fail aces but has 
                          no fail suits for which he or she does not also have 
                          the ace, the picker may still call another fail 
                          suit's ace and utilize an <i>&quot;unknown.&quot;</i> 
                          The picker lays a card face down (typically a low 
                          fail card or their lowest trump) and calls a fail 
                          suit for the unknown to represent. The unknown is 
                          played face down and has no power to take tricks, 
                          though its point value remains at the end of the 
                          game. Only the player taking the unknown is allowed 
                          to look at it until the end of the game

                        <li>
                          In some variants, the picker can call a suit for 
                          which he has the ace; he must save the ace and then 
                          he is his own &quot;secret&quot; partner.

                      The picker can choose to go alone after picking up the 
                      blind. In this case, there will be no called ace.

                  <p>
                    In this variant, the partner is automatically the 
                    individual with the jack of diamonds. Unlike the Called 
                    Ace variant, the partner is not required to play the jack 
                    of diamonds with any required haste; thus the identity of 
                    the partner is usually secret for more of the game.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The normal rule is that if the picker has the jack of 
                    diamonds, whether as a result of the deal or picking up 
                    the jack in the blind, the picker must play alone. 
                    However, there are a number of variants within this method 
                    of play.

                    <li>
                      Sometimes, the picker is allowed to <b>&quot;call up&quot;</b> 
                      to the jack of hearts if he has the jack of diamonds in 
                      his hand. Sometimes he's also allowed to call the jack 
                      of spades or clubs if he has the two or three lower 
                      jacks in his hand. Some variants require that the picker 
                      call up before seeing the blind, and thus in this 
                      variant the picker is stuck without a partner if the 
                      jack of diamonds is in the blinds.

                    <li>
                      In some variants, the picker calls the jack of clubs 
                      instead of the jack of diamonds&#8212;but typically the 
                      variant does not permit the picker to call down to the 
                      jack of spades.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In some variants, if the picker has the jack of diamonds 
                      and wishes to play alone (cut-throat), the jack of 
                      diamonds must be kept in play and not buried.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In a relatively new variant, the picker may call a 
                      non-trump ace if he has the jack of diamonds. As in the 
                      ace variations above, the picker must keep at least one 
                      card in the called suit. A difference from the typical 
                      ace variations is that the partner is usually not 
                      required to play the ace when that suit is played if 
                      they have additional cards in that suit. This is to 
                      maintain the intrigue associated with the &quot;who's the 
                      partner&quot; aspect of the game. If the picker does not have 
                      an ace they can call (an example would be five trump and 
                      an ace, king, seven of the same suit) they are 
                      considered &quot;stuck&quot; and must go alone.

                    One variant allows the picker to call &quot;sheepshead.&quot; This 
                    means that the picker believes he can take every trick. If 
                    he succeeds he receives twice the number of points for a 
                    trickless game, but if he misses a single trick (even one 
                    lacking points), he must pay twice the value his opponents 
                    would have paid him for a trickless hand.

                    <li>
                      The picker is almost always required to play alone if he 
                      calls sheepshead. Because of this, it is generally 
                      applied only to the <i>jacks</i> variant, or cut-throat 
                      games.

                    <li>
                      Sometimes the picker is not allowed to call sheepshead 
                      if he does not have the jack in five or six-handed games.

                    If the picker/partner do not win, they are &quot;bumped&quot;. The 
                    standard method of playing Sheepshead is that the 
                    picker/partner lose two times the points that opponents 
                    would lose in a similar loss. This may be called the 
                    &quot;Punish the picker&quot; rule. Some house rules do not enforce 
                    this &quot;Punish&quot; rule. Some house rules require the picker to 
                    take at least one trick. If the picker/partner do not take 
                    at least one trick and lose, then only the picker loses 
                    points. Picker -18, partner 0, opponents +6.

                    In this variant, when a player picks up the blind, any 
                    player who was not given the opportunity to pick up the 
                    blind and who is not the picker's partner may <b>knock</b> 
                    or <b>crack</b> by knocking the table with their fist. 
                    This automatically doubles the point values determining 
                    the score when the game ends. In the <i>aces</i> variant, 
                    the crack must take place after the ace has been called 
                    but before the first card is played.

                    <li>
                      Some variants allow the picker or the picker's partner 
                      to <b>re-crack,</b> or <b>crack-back</b> resulting in a 
                      quadrupling of the end scores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Some variants allow any player (who is not the picker or 
                      the picker's partner and did not crack) to <b>castrate</b> 
                      resulting in an octupling of the end scores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In another variation, after a crack the partner may <b>crack-around-the-corner,</b> 
                      serving the same effect as a re-crack, but revealing 
                      himself as the partner at the same time. Generally in 
                      any game where cracking is allowed, each player may only 
                      crack once, regardless of team.

                    This variant allows players to double the point value of 
                    the game by revealing that they have the two black or red 
                    queens.

                    <li>
                      Typically, a blitz may only occur after a crack or

                    <li>
                      Some variants allow for a blitzing with the two black

                      Some variants allow for blitzers after the hand has been 
                      played. Players with both black queens need to declare

                  <p>
                    Typically, diamonds are considered trump, but some groups 
                    use another suit (typically clubs around North Central 
                    WIsconsin). This would mean a nine of diamonds would be 
                    fail while a nine of clubs is trump instead.

                  <p>
                    Alternatively, in some groups, the strengths of the 
                    various queens and jacks differ from standard rules.

                    A variant popular in some areas of Minnesota and Wisconsin 
                    is to change the order of strength of the trump cards. 
                    This is done by increasing the seven of diamond's strength 
                    to second in the list of trump:

                  <p>
                    When playing this variant the seven of diamonds is 
                    referred to as &quot;the Spitz&quot;. Another variation puts the 
                    seven of diamonds first in the list of trump.

                    Several different scenarios can occur if no one picks up 
                    the blind, including a forced pick, a Leaster, or a 
                    Doubler.

                    In this variant, the person on the end is required to pick 
                    the blind. This is sometimes offset by a &quot;No Punish&quot; rule, 
                    and statistics; if no one desired the blind, then there's 
                    a better chance that the blind has decent cards, unless 
                    the trump is evenly spread out.

                    hand. There is no partner, and the winner simply receives 
                    one point from every opponent in the game. The blind is 
                    set aside and normally given to the player who takes the 
                    last trick. House rules may allow the dealer to declare 
                    which trick is given the blind (e.g. the first trick, or 
                    the second, etc.). Another house rule may be to set the 
                    blind aside so it is not given to anyone. The blind is not 
                    viewed until after the hand is over.

                      A common variant is to require a trick to win. In this 
                      variant, therefore, a player who takes every trick wins. 
                      As two further variants to this variant: (A) if a player 
                      takes a trick that has no points (all 7s 8s and 9s), 
                      and/or (B) a player wins by taking every trick&#8212;then, the 
                      winners gets points as if winning a &quot;no trick&quot; after 
                      picking up the blinds.

                    <li>
                      One variant used when playing with three players is: a 
                      player may win without taking a trick, and actually wins 
                      double in this situation.

                      In the event of a tied score, no stakes are exchanged, 
                      and the game proceeds to the next hand.
                    </li>

                  <p>
                    A variant of the leaster is the moster, which is played 
                    the same as a leaster, but after the hand is scored, the 
                    player who took the most points pays out (as if for a 
                    simple loss) to all the rest of the players. Thus, in a 
                    five-player game, the affected player loses four points 
                    and the opponents get one each, unless the score is 
                    doubled by other means (cracking, etc.). The exception is 
                    taking all of the tricks, which is still scored as a win 
                    by the player doing so.

                    In a doubler, the cards are reshuffled and a new hand is 
                    dealt and played as normal. However, at the end of this 
                    redeal, the point values lost and gained are doubled.

                    Typically occurring with a leaster (and during cash 
                    games), one point is placed into a pot for the next hand. 
                    Then, if the picker wins the hand, he splits the pot with 
                    the partner (in a five handed game, the extra point goes 
                    to the picker such that he receives three and the partner 
                    receives a single point). However, if the picker loses the 
                    hand, the picker and partner must pay into the pot what 
                    they would have received.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In some games, the picker and partner double the pot 
                      when losing; in others, they simply add a single pot 
                      each time. Additionally, the picker and partner may take 
                      the entire pot on a win, or they may receive a single 
                      pot.

                      If the game ends before the pot is taken, or continues 
                      to build over several turns, the pot may be divided out 
                      to the individuals evenly. Alternately, showdowns may be 
                      played, where five cards are dealt one at a time to 
                      every player face side up. The best five-card poker hand 
                      then takes one or all of the pots.

                      If a new player joins a game with a pot (bringing a game 
                      from five to six-handed, etc.,) typically the pot is 
                      divided up, or the new player adds one point for every 
                      pot present.

                    There are numerous variations in rules, so a discussion of 
                    house rules generally occurs before play begins. The 
                    following variations can be employed to accommodate 
                    different numbers of players.

                  <p>
                    1) Each player is dealt four cards in a row, face down. 
                    Then, four cards are dealt face up to each player and 
                    placed on top of the first four cards. Then, eight cards 
                    are dealt to each player's hand. When one of the face up 
                    cards is played, the card below it is turned face up and 
                    may then be played.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2) Sixteen cards are dealt face down in a four by four 
                    rectangle. Players are not allowed to look at the 
                    face-down cards. Then, a card is dealt face up on top of 
                    these. The sixteen cards (eight stacks of two cards) 
                    closest to the dealer are the dealer's cards. A card must 
                    be face-up to be played. The opponent starts the first 
                    trick by playing one of his face-up cards, and the dealer 
                    responds by playing one of his. After each trick is 
                    played, any face-down cards uncovered are turned face-up. 
                    Play continues until all 32 cards have been played. 
                    Players are not allowed to look at their own face-down 
                    cards.

                    1) Each player is dealt ten cards, with two going to the 
                    blind. The picker faces the other two players.

                  <p>
                    2) The sevens of clubs and spades are removed, leaving 
                    thirty cards. Nine cards are then dealt to each player, 
                    with three going to the blind. The picker faces the others.

                  <p>
                    3) The six non-trump sevens and eights are removed, 
                    dealing eight cards to each player, with two in the blind.
                  </p>

                    1) Seven cards are dealt to each player with four in the 
                    blind. Given the large blind, this variation required the 
                    picker go <i>cut-throat</i> (without a partner).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2) The seven of clubs and seven of spades are removed (<i>or</i> 
                    the six of clubs and six of spades are added). Seven (or 
                    eight) cards are dealt to each player, with two in the 
                    blind. Either the jack or ace partner rules may be used.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3) Each player is dealt eight cards, with no blind. Either 
                    (A) the two players holding the black queens are partners, 
                    where the partners are secret until both cards are played, 
                    a player holding both black queens plays cut-throat 
                    against the three other; or (B) the partners are the first 
                    two queens played. In both these variations, the players 
                    with the queens (black or first two played) are considered 
                    the picker and partner for scoring purposes. In the latter 
                    variation, the timing of playing queens is important. For 
                    example, it may be worth it to waste the queen to become 
                    partners with an individual who has already taken a good 
                    trick or two, or to avoid being stuck cut-throat.

                  <p>
                    5) In this variation popular in southern Indiana, jacks 
                    are higher than queens (still 
                    clubs-spades-hearts-diamonds), and hearts (rather than 
                    diamonds) are trump. All four players are dealt eight 
                    cards. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, 
                    the player has the option to &quot;<b>call</b>&quot; (<a href="/wiki/Sheepshead_(game)#Partners" title="Sheepshead (game)">call 
                    an fail-suit ace for a partner</a>), go solo (cut-throat), 
                    or pass. When going solo, the player may play a &quot;<b>best</b>&quot; 
                    (pay normally against the other three), a &quot;<b>side 
                    solo</b>&quot; (call another suit rather than hearts to be 
                    trump, and then play against the other three), or a &quot;<b>Billy</b>&quot; 
                    (plays against the three others but attempts not to take a 
                    trick).

                    4) Four cards are dealt to each player, with four to the 
                    blind. A die is rolled, and the partner is whatever number 
                    is on the die with 1 representing the player to the 
                    pickers left, and counting clockwise with six being the 
                    person to the picker's right. Each takes and buries two 
                    cards.

                    If one partner has two of these cards, they can call the 8 
                    of diamonds (if they have the 7 and the queen or jack) or 
                    jack of hearts (if they have the queen and the jack). If 
                    the other partner already has the 8 of diamonds or jack of 
                    hearts they can call again. It should always be 3 on 5 
                    unless the partner chooses not to call another partner.

                    A player &quot;mauers&quot; when the player has enough power-cards 
                    to pick up the blind, and yet passes (whether for fear 
                    one's hand is not actually good enough, or worse, one 
                    hopes to set up another player to lose). Mauering is 
                    considered to be in very poor taste and in some cases 
                    players who do it often enough can be asked to leave a 
                    game. Of course, mauering can backfire if the hand results 
                    in a leaster, and the mauerer is stuck with what is then a 
                    poor hand.

                  <p>
                    There are different methods of deciding if a player has a 
                    strong hand. In a five-handed game, some players pick on 
                    any four trump, while others decide based on the number of 
                    higher trump (queens and jacks). Others use a numbering 
                    system, giving each type of trump a point value and making 
                    the decision to pick based on a certain number of points. 
                    Statistically, players who have an opportunity to pick 
                    first need a stronger hand, while picking on the end 
                    usually means that since nobody else picked, the trump are 
                    fairly evenly spread out. Because of the complex nature of 
                    the game, in most cases mauering is a matter of opinion.

                    A player &quot;schmears&quot; a trick by playing a high-point card 
                    (usually an ace or ten) into a trick that a player thinks 
                    will be (or has already been) taken by one of their 
                    partners, in order to increase the points earned on that 
                    trick. The term may also be a noun, referring to the 
                    high-point card played in this manner. An example of 
                    schmearing (by Opponents 2 and 3):
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Partner leads <span><font color="red">10&#9830;</font></span> 
                      (10 points)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Opponent 1 plays Q&#9827; (3 points)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Opponent 2 plays <span><font color="red">A&#9830;</font></span> 
                      (11 points)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Picker plays <span><font color="red">8&#9830;</font></span> 
                      (0 points)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Opponent 3 (out of trump) plays 10&#9824; (10 points)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    This trick was worth 34 points. That's schneider all by 
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opponent 1 is guaranteed to win the trick as the queen of 
                    clubs is the highest card. As a result, opponents 2 and 3 
                    both took advantage of the situation and put high-counting 
                    cards down. Also note that the picker played the <span><font color="red">8&#9830;</font></span>, 
                    a no-counting card&#8212;the opposite of schmearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Schmearing is an important strategy. In this example, 
                    schmearing increased the value of the trick by 21 points 
                    to a total of 34 points&#8212;schneider all by itself and over a 
                    quarter of the points available.

                    party forfeiting the hand.

                    When a player holds all or most of the top trump there is 
                    no way for the opposition to win. This unusually powerful 
                    hand is often derided for its ease of play; &quot;My granny 
                    could win that hand.&quot; The hand still counts and is played 
                    out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In some circles, the player simply lays down the granny 
                    hand and the opponents conceding by acclamation. Even if 
                    not completely a granny hand, some circles permit a player 
                    to state that he believes he will take all of the 
                    remaining tricks (possibly requiring an explanation, say, 
                    &quot;I have all of the remaining trump&quot;), giving opponents an 
                    opportunity to object (say, if the calling player 
                    miscounted trump) -- forestalling the players from needing 
                    to play out the remainder of the hand.

                    Sometimes this is unavoidable especially in cases where

                    As with any partner game, code words or signs can be used 
                    to cheat. This involves 2 players creating a word or 
                    phrase which tells their partner in crime what to lead. 
                    For instance, Player A and Player B are colluding with 
                    each other in a game of 4 handed. Player A has the lead 
                    and Player B is behind the dealer without a fail Spade. 
                    Player B uses the phrase &quot;let's rock n' roll&quot; to signal 
                    Player A to lead spades. Player A leads spades, the picker 
                    trumps it, and Player B trumps over the Picker. This is 
                    very much frowned upon and if caught, the players are 
                    usually kicked out of the game.

                    A player &quot;throws off&quot; when, after a fail card is played 
                    and the player does not have any of that fail suit but 
                    does have trump, decides to play a fail card rather than 
                    trump. The throw off is key to winning at Sheepshead. One 
                    must know when to throw off and when not to throw off. One 
                    popular situation to throw off is as follows and is known 
                    as &quot;The Throw Off&quot;; (1) a fail suit is led that the picker 
                    does not have, (2) the picker is 2nd in line, and (3) the 
                    picker throws off, usually because he has a poor hand, 
                    hoping his partner can take the trick.
